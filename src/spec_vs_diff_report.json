  "summary": "Diff implements robust SVG path tokenization/parsing and expands polygon conversion to support additional commands with curve/arc flattening, adds a user-facing polygon quality control (low/medium/high) that recomputes output, and keeps path() and polygon() outputs/error states independent in UI.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "If the input is malformed, the error message remains in English and indicates the command/context that failed parsing.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a new tokenizer that throws errors, but the error-message construction is truncated before we can verify it includes the specific command/context that failed (as opposed to a generic parse error).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/lib/pathConverter.ts (tokenizePath() error construction is truncated in diff)"
