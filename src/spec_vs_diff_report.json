  "summary": "REQ-2 and REQ-3 appear implemented: PreviewSection now supports Input/Output preview tabs and ConverterSection passes svgPath into PreviewSection. REQ-1 is partially implemented (renders svgPath in an <svg><path>) but the diff does not show explicit handling for invalid path data (placeholder state for invalid input). The diff also includes unrequested/forbidden edits (useInternetIdentity hook) and an unrequested project_state.json file.",

      "requirement": "If the input is empty or invalid, the input preview area shows an empty/placeholder state instead of throwing errors.",
      "reason": "InputPreview shows a placeholder only when svgPath is empty/whitespace; there is no check for invalid SVG path data (e.g., based on parse/validation result or the existing error state) before rendering <path d={svgPath}>.",
